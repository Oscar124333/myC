## Overview
Bicycle incremental with random elements and interactive gameplay.
Setting is a small town, route will be between two places. Capability to unlock better bikes, better routes, and better upgrades.


## Plan
+ Start with a storyline; you have to get to school on time everyday
+ Add at least one function every time I have freetime

## Outline/Concepts

### Gameplay (campaign based)
+ Start
+ Middle
+ End

Progression based on upgrades attained, calculated by averaging the "power" of the bike.

### Gameplay (free-play)
+ No minimum requirement to proceed
+ Requires random world generation (seed-base?)    

Progression is player-paced, upgrades are 100% incremental and maps/routes can be randomly generated. 

## To Do
- Refactor/enumerate prompts
    -(x) Simplify repetitive decor (stars, lines, etc) via loops
    -(x) Have several prototypes and function calls for such
    - Automatic prompts and notification system (notifs optional)
- In-game day system
- Save system with file I/O
- Collection of events, modifiers, and accidents
- Upgrades
- Speed calculator (repeatedly spits out as match goes on)


## Misc Ideas
- Shrimp chips currency
- Weight Management for speed
    - Certain days have different modifiers and events that require items
    - Random holidays, set cooldown before random occurances start
- Choose type of character you are playing; evolution as the game goes on
- Weekends are when upgrades are done (mini motorways inspo)
