## Overview
Bicycle incremental with random elements and interactive gameplay.
Setting is a small town, route will be between two places. Capability to unlock better bikes, better routes, and better upgrades.

## Plan
Start with a storyline; you have to get to school on time everyday

## To Do
- Refactor/enumerate prompts
    - Simplify repetitive decor (stars, lines, etc) via loops
    - Have several prototypes and function calls for such
    - Automatic prompts and notification system (notifs optional)
- In-game day system
- Collection of events, modifiers, and accidents

## Ideas
- Shrimp chips currency
- Weight Management for speed
    - Certain days have different modifiers and events that require items
    - Random holidays, set cooldown before random occurances start
- Choose type of character you are playing; evolution as the game goes on
- Weekends are when upgrades are done (mini motorways inspo)
