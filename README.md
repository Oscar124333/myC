# myC | Oscar
Hi! This is Oscar's small page for `miscellaneous projects` that come to mind whenever and wherever.
These projects are usually quite *small*, but a few of them are *probably* kind of fun!
## Current Projects
+ hello.c
  + Simple & interactive `Hello World` program!
+ fibonacci.c
  + Gives a Fibonacci number from the user's desired *n* of Fibonacci.
+ numnames.c
  + Writes out the English word for the user's desired __*whole number*__, up to 1 quadrillion not inclusive (15 digits).
+ diceroll.c
  + Random D6 roller up to 25 dice, OR manually choose limitless # of sides AND # of dice!
### Notes
+ numnames.c does not work with flat numbers past the thousands... (i.e. 9000000 -> nine million  thousand )
## Ideas
- Incremental clicker game
- Bicycle racing incremental
  - similar to 'Duck Life' loop
- Use file I/O to save data
- Terminal-based periodic table
  - option to toggle whole view or individual data points, or to do flashcard mode: reveal data after element is chosen
  - add flashcardable topics as year goes on?
- Terminal-based dot book
  - similar to periodic table functionality
