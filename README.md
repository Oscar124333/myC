# myC | Oscar
Hi! This is Oscar's small page for **miscellaneous projects** that come to mind whenever and wherever.
These projects are usually quite *small*... but a few of them are kind of fun!
## Current Projects
+ `hello.c`
  + Simple & interactive `Hello World` program!
+ `fibonacci.c`
  + Gives a Fibonacci number from the user's desired *n* of Fibonacci.
+ `numnames.c`
  + Writes out the English word for the user's desired __*whole number*__, up to 1 quadrillion not inclusive (15 digits).
+ `diceroll.c`
  + Random D6 roller up to 25 dice, OR manually choose limitless # of sides AND # of dice!
+ `bicyclegame/bicycle.c`
  + Incremental game centered on a bicycle and a commute to school. It is currently being worked on in a separate repository, but a very barebones version still exists on here.
+ `measurements.c`
  + Converts to and from many measurements, imperial and metric. It is pretty accurate.
### Notes
+ `numnames.c` does not work with flat numbers past the thousands... (i.e. 9000000 -> nine million  thousand )
## Ideas
- Use file I/O to save data for games
- Incremental clicker game
- Terminal-based periodic table
  - option to toggle whole view or individual data points, or to do flashcard mode: reveal data after element is chosen
  - add flashcardable topics as year goes on?
- Terminal-based dot book
  - similar to periodic table functionality
